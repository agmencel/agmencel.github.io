  <p><em>Progress in Programming</em></p>

<p>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</p>

<p>First of all, I would say my troubleshooting skills have greatly improved. I was able to not only find and fix issues myself, but also ask for assistance
when needed. I also can say that I am much more fluent in reading the different languages and full understanding what each thing does and the logic behind
all of it, as before I only somewhat understood it.</p>

<p>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</p>

<p>I definitely still need to work on organizing my work and making sure that I have no wasted code. I also feel there is always ample opportunity to improve
how well you can understand, read and write code fluently.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</p>

<p>I have learned a lot, especially in the troubleshooting department and using my resources from the WODs. While I will say having the screencast available
for help is definitely beneficial, I did find myself using them as a crutch during certain moments. I do wish however that they would still be accessible
more easily as I did spend a great amount of time on some simple mistakes on previous WODs.</p>

<p>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</p>

<p>Especially the last few labs that applied directly to assignment 1, it was beneficial. Seeing how the practice we do in labs translates directly to a real (or
somewhat real) application makes it not only more digestable, but rewarding as well.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</p>

<p>I definitely learned an immense amount from Assignment 1 and am very confident I will be just fine on Assignment 2.</p>

<p>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</p>

<p>I think spending more in-class time working directly on the Assignment 1, and having less focus on the labs can help. In other words, I do wish the Labs
such as lab 12 correlate directly to Assignment 1, rather than us simply adapting it to fit.</p>

<p>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</p>

<p>I definitely find that Labs and one on one help are the most beneficial. But I have also found it nice to collaborate with classmates as they may have
better ideas on how to do something than I did.</p>
