*Why I chose to major in MIS*

When originally deciding what I wanted for my college degree fresh out of high school, I initially thought computer science would be my go to. Following graduation in 2019 however, I enlisted in the Hawaii Air National Guard. Subsequently, after attending UH Manoa in Fall 2019, I would go on to miss multiple semesters due to training for the military. 

Because of this, and the fact that I had been unable to retain key knowledge from my Calculus and other classes, I chose to move to MIS. My older sister had majored in MIS and I understood that it involved some aspects of computer science, therefor it would still be of interest to me.

Along with college, as I mentioned earlier, I am in the Hawaii Air National Guard. The current plan following graduation is to commission as an officer and attend flight school for the Air Force.
