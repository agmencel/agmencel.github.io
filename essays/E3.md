*Preparing for WODs*

The [Invoice 1 WOD](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) was a task to test the ability to 
create a sales receipt for a sale that contains at least five different products.

Starting off, I first did a dry run through the WOD without recording. The main thing that went well during this first run was setting up all
the product data and the general layout of the table. I did not really struggle much outside of a few syntax errors.

Similar to previous WODs I first did the dry run as mentioned. I then watched the screen cast to compare the techniques used, and finally I recorded
the WOD and submitted.

I think for the next WOD I would have ran through it a bit more before viewing the screen cast to fully grasp the basics of what to do.
